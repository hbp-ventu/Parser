# Parser

Expression parser in PHP.

This started as a PHP port of the javascript expression parser by Eric Nielsen : https://github.com/ericbn/js-abstract-descent-parser

I then added functions, variables and objects; the result is in Parser.php.

Script.php is a small Python-like script language written in PHP, it uses the parser of evaluating expressions.
